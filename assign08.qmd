## Assignment 8: Spatial Data

The purpose of this assignment was to learn spatial data to learn the median age in the USA using the 2019 US Census Data. We start doing so by downloading the tidycensus and tigris packages. After downloading said packages, we can start observing the variables in our census dataset that will ultimately dictate the median age in each state. These variables account for sex, age, geography, among other important demographic information Additionally, access to US census data neccesites an API Key from Census API Data Service. After running, these vectors we can narrow our search to seek the median age data.

Before plotting actualizing the data we run a plain map of the US:

Since we have the schematic of the map, we are now able to apply the demographic variables we already ran on a map, which captures all of our data:

To compare data to the median age by state in 2009, I tweaked the year in the code and generated this map:

While, the map look like somewhat similar there are a few variable differences seen between 2009 and 2019, particularly in the Midwest where the median age is increasing. Regions like the east and west coast continue to maintain very similar demographics.

To compare further we I also tweaked the code to run the median age for the 2020 census data. Unfortunately, due to low-response rates the census just estimated the data. This is how it appeared in the console"

```         
The regular 1-year ACS for 2020 was not released and is not available in tidycensus. â„¹ Due to low response rates, the Census Bureau instead released a set of experimental estimates for the 2020 1-year ACS.
