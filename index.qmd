## Assignment 3

In this assignment we were asked to analyze Biden-Xi summit that took place in November 2021. During this summit, Biden and Xi discussed China's domestic policies, trade relationships, and security issues regarding the Asian region (Politico). For this assignment, we used the R alongside a Quantenda package to scrape and analyze Twitter data on the day of the summit. The twitter data analyzed displayed activity ranging from interactions, trending hashtags, popular users that were tagged, and prominent rhetoric on the day of the summit.

This is the summary of data:

The most popular hashtags on that were" #china"," #joebiden"," #xinjinping", and "#america". Other popular hashtags were "#usa," "#breakingnews," and "pray4america." Quantenda data also pulled other popular hashtags from twitters among the ones not notes above are: "#uyghurgenocide," "#uyghur," "#humanrights," "tibetans," "taiwan," "#coronavirus," and interestingly enough "#fentanyl." This plot shows how the variety of hashtags were used, and their connection with one another.

The Quantenda data allowed us to look at the 20 top users that were featured on the data matrix. The five top users mentioned were \@POTUS, \@JoeBiden, \@Politico \@EnesKanter, and \@jendeben. The accompanying plot displays the interaction between various twitter users.

Another data point was analyzing lexical dispersion of US Presidents from 1953 to 2021. This plot ranged from 1953 when president Eisenhower was in office to current president Joe Biden. There is a lexical dispersion plot aimed to account for the frequency of times that presidents have used the term 'american,' in their speeches. In the plots this accounted for by referring to the term 'relative token index.' There is a wide variation of frequency among the US presidents, but according to the plot the use of the term does seem to slight increase around 1993 when Clinton was in office.

The second part of the lexical dispersion plot was comparing the frequencies between the words "american," and "people." The word "people," showed less variation among presidents and was used quite frequently among all of them.

Lastly, we were asked to discuss Wordfish it. Wordfish analyzes positions of documents based on word frequencies. They do so by using a one-dimension scaling model.

## Assignment 2

I examined that number of searches for 'Trump' following the announcement of his election on June 6th 2015 for the 2016 US Election, up until 2023. I also examined the searches for 'Biden' following the same dates as my previous search.

In October and November 2016 there was a spike in searches for 'Trump,' coinciding to the election date. There was another sharp peak in 'Trump,' searches in October and November 2020. The search item 'Biden' was at its peak between the years of 2015 and 2023 in November 2020 during the election. Following the November 2020 election there was still more searches for 'Biden,' compared years 2015-early 2019, but not as frequent as the years of 2019 and 2020. The term 'Election' has a varied number of searches over time. The highest peaks being November 2016 and November 2020. There was a sharp dip of searches after January 2021, with some peaks in the searches in early to mid 2023.

All of the searches were exclusive to Google trends in the United States.

## Assignment 1

Analysis of survey:

Q2a. The survey is structured in a way where questions concerning the content is presented before the demographic information is asked.

Q2b. The questionnaire is composed of an array of different questions, that range from binary answers like yes or no to Likert scales questions. The survey also includes questions that have logic, this always questions to be followed up or skipped based on questions with binary responses.

Q2c. The questions are ordered so that the survey questions are presented first and the demographics are placed last.

Q7. One way to improve a respondent's experience is to break up the survey into sections to maintain cohesion and synchronicity throughout the survey.
