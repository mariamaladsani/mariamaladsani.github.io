    "text": "I am currently a master’s student at the University of Texas at Dallas’ Applied Cognition and Neuroscience program. In the spring of 2022, I graduated from Boston University with a BA in Psychology and a double minor in Philosophy and Comparative Literature. During my undergraduate career, I partook in research involving molecular neuroscience and clinical neuropsychology. In Dr. Ryan Logan’s lab in the Boston University School of Medicine, I worked on a project that investigated the role of circadian rhythms in opiod-seeking, craving, and relapse. At the Manoach Lab at Massachusetts General Hospital, I worked on a study investigating the relationship between memory consolidation and sleep in schizophrenic patients using EEG, MRI, and MEG, as well as neuropsychological assessments.\nDuring my graduate studies I am hoping to bridge my interests in both molecular neuroscience and neuropsychology. I am interested in how social and environmental factors in early life can impact and/or impair cognitive functions like memory later on in life. Overall, I aspire to be a well-rounded neuroscientist by conducting research that draws from different disciplines and methods.\nYou can find my CV here.\n\n1 + 1\n\n[1] 2"

    "text": "Assignment 3\nIn this assignment we were asked to analyze Biden-Xi summit that took place in November 2021. During this summit, Biden and Xi discussed China’s domestic policies, trade relationships, and securty issues reagarding the Asian region (Politico). For this assignent, we used the R alongside the Quantenda package to scrape and analyze Twitter data on the day of the summit. The twitter data analyzed displayed activity ranging from interactions, trending hashtags, popular users that were tagged, and prominent rhetoric on the day of the summit.\nThis is the summary of data:\nThe most popular hashtags on that were” #china”,” #joebiden”,” #xinjinping”, and “#america”. Other popular hashtags were “#usa,” “#breakingnews,” and “pray4ameria.” The Quantenda data also pulled other populat hashtags from twitters among the ones not notes above are: “#uyghurgenocide,” “#uyghur,” “#humanrights,” “tibetans,” “taiwan,” “#coronavirus,” and interestingly enough “#fentanyl.” This plot shows how the variety of hashtags were used, and their relationship with one another.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Quantenda data allowed us to look at the 20 top users that were featured on the data matrix. The five top users mentioned were @POTUS, @JoeBiden, @Politico @EnesKanter, and @jendeben. The accompanying plot displays the interaction between various twitter users.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnother data point was analyzing lexical dispersion of US Presidents from 1953 to 2021. This plot ranged from 1953 when president Eisenhower was in office to current president Joe Biden. There is a lexical dispersion plot aimed to account for the frequency of times that presidents have used the term ‘american,’ in their speeches. In the plots this accounted for by referring to the term ‘relative token index.’ There is a wide variation of frequency among the US presidents, but according to the plot the use of the term does seem to slight increase around 1993 when Clinton was in office.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe second part of the lexical dispersion plot was comparing the frequencies between the words “american,” and “people.” The word “people,” showed less variation among presidents and was used quite frequently among all of them.\n\n\n\n\n\nLastly, we were asked to discuss Wordfish it. Wordfish analyzes positions of documents based on word frequencies. They do so by using a one-dimension scaling model."
