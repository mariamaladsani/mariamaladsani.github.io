    "text": "I am currently a master’s student at the University of Texas at Dallas’ Applied Cognition and Neuroscience program. In the spring of 2022, I graduated from Boston University with a BA in Psychology and a double minor in Philosophy and Comparative Literature. During my undergraduate career, I partook in research involving molecular neuroscience and clinical neuropsychology. In Dr. Ryan Logan’s lab in the Boston University School of Medicine, I worked on a project that investigated the role of circadian rhythms in opiod-seeking, craving, and relapse. At the Manoach Lab at Massachusetts General Hospital, I worked on a study investigating the relationship between memory consolidation and sleep in schizophrenic patients using EEG, MRI, and MEG, as well as neuropsychological assessments.\nDuring my graduate studies I am hoping to bridge my interests in both molecular neuroscience and neuropsychology. I am interested in how social and environmental factors in early life can impact and/or impair cognitive functions like memory later on in life. Overall, I aspire to be a well-rounded neuroscientist by conducting research that draws from different disciplines and methods.\nYou can find my CV here.\n\n1 + 1\n\n[1] 2"

The questionnaire is composed of an array of different questions, that range from binary answers like yes or no to Likert scales questions. The survey also includes questions that have logic, this always questions to be followed up or skipped based on questions with binary responses.\nQ2c. The questions are ordered so that the survey questions are presented first and the demographics are placed last.\nQ7. One way to improve a respondent’s experience is to break up the survey into sections to maintain cohesion and synchronicity throughout the survey.\n\n1 + 1\n\n[1] 2"

There was another sharp peak in ‘Trump,’ searches in October and November 2020. The search item ‘Biden’ was at its peak between the years of 2015 and 2023 in November 2020 during the election.
